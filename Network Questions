1. How to find logs of a specific column.

    cat system.log | cut -d ' ' -f 1-6      or     cat system.log | awk '{print $1, $2}'
    cat - reads file content                            awk command used to scan and reads the feilds and format output, NR no of line, nf last feild             
    cut -  reads the columns  
    -d - delimiter in this case whitespace
    -f - which feilds to be out put
    
    $ echo "abc def" | cut -f 2 -d ' '
    def
    $ echo "abc    def" | cut -f 2 -d ' '

    $ echo " abc def" | cut -f 2 -d ' '
    abc


    $ echo "abc def" | awk '{ print $2 }'
    def
    $ echo "abc    def" | awk '{ print $2 }'
    def
    $ echo " abc def" | awk '{ print $2 }'
    def
    
2. how to compress a file?

  Tar command "tar -czvf logs_archive.tar.gz * --remove-files"  to delete original file after compressions
              "tar -xzvf logs_archive.tar.gz &"         to continue in bg add &
              "zgrep -Hna 'string-to-search' compressedFile.tar.gz"
              
  -c	Create a new archive.	We use this flag whenever we need to create a new archive.
  -z	Use gzip compression.	When we specify this flag, it means that archive will be created using gzip compression.
  -v	Provide verbose output.	Providing the -v flag shows details of the files compressed.
  -f	Archive file name.	Archive file names are mapped using the -f flag.
  -x	Extract from a compressed file.	We use this flag when files need to be extracted from an archive.
  -t - view the contents


3. How to truncket a file?

  truncating a file means removing the file contents without deleting the file.
  sudo truncate -s 0 /var/log/nginx/access.log   -s=size

4. How to clear logs?

  find /var/log -type f -delete  (it deletes the files) but deleteing the file is not recommanded instead delete the content, logrotate
      for logfile in $(ls /var/log/*.log)
      do 
       truncate -s 0 $logfile
      done

5. How to clear disc space in linux?

  sudo df -h /dev/sda(for specific drive) (view the space in -h readable form)
  sudo yum autoremove (to removes packages that are no longer in use)
  sudo yum clean all (Clean cache by package manager)
  sudo yum list installed (lists packages)
  sudo yum remove nginx (remove particular package)

6. How to configure DNS?

    sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf  (add name server and IP) this will used as temporry
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/resolved.conf  (uncomment resolved section with fallbackdns with IP)
    ----there is resolvconf package to manage DNS----
    -----Use dig command to know the dns used ----

7. how to do patching

    diff -u working/slang.c latest/slang.c  (to show differences bw files)
    diff -u working/slang.c latest/slang.c > slang.patch  (to create a patch with the differences)
    patch -u working/slang.c -i slang.patch  (patching a file)
    patch -u -b working/slang.c -i slang.patch (-b to take backup before patching and -i input of patchfile name)
    diff -ruN working/ latest/ > slang.patch (creating patching file for whole directory)
    less slang.patch (will display the contents)
    patch --dry-run -ruN -d working < slang.patch (r- recurssive u-unified context N- new file)
    patch -R < myfile.patch (reverse the patch)

8. Command for patching a specific package? Networking

9. Hard Link :
        A hard link acts as a copy (mirrored) of the selected file. It accesses the data available in the original file.
        If the earlier selected file is deleted, the hard link to the file will still contain the data of that file.
        ln source.file hardlink.file
   Soft Link :
        A soft link (also known as Symbolic link) acts as a pointer or a reference to the file name. It does not access the data available in the
        original file. If the earlier file is deleted, the soft link will be pointing to a file that does not exist anymore.

        ln -s source.file softlink.file

1. what is OSI model

    Open Systems Interconnection - It is a 7 layer architecture with each layer having specific functionality to perform. 
    All these 7 layers work collaboratively to transmit the data from one person to another across the globe. 
      Physical Layer (Layer 1) - When receiving data, this layer will get the signal received and convert it into 0s and 1s and send them to the
                                  Data Link layer, which will put the frame back together. 
      Data Link Layer (DLL) (Layer 2)  - The data link layer is responsible for the node-to-node delivery of the message. The main function of this
      layer is to make sure data transfer is error-free from one node to another, over the physical layer.
      
      Network Layer (Layer 3) :  The network layer works for the transmission of data from one host to the other located in different networks. It also 
      takes care of packet routing i.e. selection of the shortest path to transmit the packet, from the number of routes available. The sender & receiver’s 
      IP addresses are placed in the header by the network layer. 
      ----routing and logical addressing (IP)--- Network layer is implemented by networking devices such as routers. 
      
      Transport Layer (Layer 4) :  The data in the transport layer is referred to as Segments. It is responsible for the End to End Delivery of the complete message. 
      ----TCP and UDP----
      
      Session Layer (Layer 5) : This layer is responsible for the establishment of connection, maintenance of sessions, authentication, and also ensures security. 
      
      Presentation Layer (Layer 6):The data from the application layer is extracted here and manipulated as per the required format to transmit over the network. 
      ----encryption and decryption---
      
      Application Layer (Layer 7) : These applications produce the data, which has to be transferred over the network. This layer also serves as a window 
      for the application services to access the network and for displaying the received information to the user. 

        Example: Application – Browsers, Skype Messenger, etc.

2. What is DNS

    Domain name system portno is 53
     translate domain names into IP addresses, allowing the browsers to access other internet resources. A DNS record is an IP address that matches the fully-qualified domain name.

------------------------------

1. what is VPC? what is diff between public and private subnet?

  A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It is a private area logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud
  A public subnet is a subnet that is associated with a route table that has a route to an Internet gateway.
  A private subnet is a subnet that is associated with a route table that doesn’t have a route to an internet gateway. Uses NAT
  we have many security measures and tools to prevent unwanted traffic like Security Groups, NACL, AWS WAF on top of existing VPC,Subnets and Routing Table to shape the traffic.
  

2. How to secure your EC2?

  using security groups, Iam roles and backups, avoiding malware

3. what is diff between permission and trust relationship?
4. what is diff between VPC peering and transit gateway?

  VPC Peering provides Full-mesh architecture while Transit Gateway provides hub-and-spoke architecture.
  AWS VPC Peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them privately. 
  Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network.
  AWS Transit Gateway is a fully managed service that connects VPCs and On-Premises networks through a central hub without relying
  on numerous point-to-point connections or Transit VPC.

5. What is private link?

    AWS PrivateLink is a networking feature provided by Amazon Web Services ( AWS) that eases and secures connectivity between Amazon Virtual Private Clouds ( VPCs ), 
    other Amazon cloud services and on-premises applications.

6. What are storage services available?

    1, Simple Storage Service (S3)
    2. Elastic Block Storage (EBS)
    3. Elastic File System (EFS)
    4. Amazon FSx for Lustre
    5. Amazon S3 Glacier
    6. Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
    7. AWS Storage Gateway

7. What is Cloudfront? How to deploy Cloudfront?

    Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your users. CloudFront
    delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. 
    
    

8. How to monitor VPC?

    You can use VPC Flow Logs to capture detailed information about the traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPCs. You can use IPAM to plan, track, 
    and monitor IP addresses for your workloads.

9. What is Elastic Beanstalk?

    AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an orchestration service offered by Amazon Web Services for deploying applications which orchestrates various AWS services, including EC2, S3, 
    Simple Notification Service (SNS), CloudWatch, autoscaling, and Elastic Load Balancers.

10. What are diff type of load balancer? and use of that.

11. Diff between ALB & NLB?
12. What are the diff type of storage available in S3?
13. How to get log of ALB?

    Elastic Load Balancing publishes a log file for each load balancer node every 5 minutes. Log delivery is eventually consistent. The load balancer can deliver multiple logs for the same period. 
    This usually happens if the site has high traffic.
    On the Edit load balancer attributes page, do the following:

            For Monitoring, turn on Access logs.

            Choose Browse S3 and select a bucket to use. Alternatively, enter the location of your S3 bucket, including any prefix.

            Choose Save changes.
