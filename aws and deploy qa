Cognito - Amazon Cognito provides authentication, authorization, and user management for your web and mobile apps. Your users can sign in directly with a 
user name and password, or through a third party such as Facebook, Amazon, Google or Apple.

The two main components of Amazon Cognito are user pools and identity pools. User pools are user directories that provide sign-up and sign-in options for
your app users. Identity pools enable you to grant your users access to other AWS services.
 You can use identity pools and user pools separately or together.

cloud watch -Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and the applications you run on AWS in real time. You can use CloudWatch to
collect and track metrics, which are variables you can measure for your resources and applications. The CloudWatch home page automatically displays metrics
 about every AWS service you use.

Cloudfront - Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files,
 to your users

by slowly rolling out the change to a small subset of users before making it available to everybody
